# Home_Sale
Model 22 Challenge
* A new repository named "Home_sales" was established.
* The Module 22 Challenge files were obtained and downloaded.
* Google Colab was accessed, and subsequently, the "Home_Sales_started_code.ipynd" file was opened and renamed as "HOME_Sales.ipynb".
*  Furthermore, a temporary table named "home_sales" was created.
*  By utilizing Spark SQL, the following question was addressed.
*  During a tutoring session, I received assistance with a few inquiries.
*  Towards the end, the "Home_sales" temporary table was uncached, and the verification of the uncache process was conducted using PySpark.

* Subsequently, the "Home_Sales.ipynb" file was downloaded to my GitHub repository. 
* To provide further clarity, a README file was prepared, elucidating the steps undertaken to accomplish this project.
